# MGL Website Update Recommendations

## Type System Improvements

### Current Issues
- TypeScript type issues in roster data mapping (e.g., `Property 'display_name' does not exist on type '{ display_name: any; avatar_url: any; }[]'`)
- Need for comprehensive refactor of data fetching and state management code
- Inconsistent type definitions across components
- Missing type definitions for API responses
- Incomplete interface definitions (e.g., missing fields in PaymentMetadata)
- Type errors in form handling

### Recommended Approach
1. Create proper interfaces for all data structures
2. Implement strict type checking for API responses
3. Refactor state management to use proper typing
4. Add type guards where necessary
5. Document type system architecture

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- Reduces runtime errors and improves code reliability
- Enhances developer experience with better autocomplete
- Makes refactoring safer and more predictable
- Improves code documentation through types
- Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime

#### Cons
- Significant upfront time investment
- May require extensive refactoring of existing code
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with TypeScript
- Potential for over-engineering if types are too complex
- May slow down initial development velocity

## Payment System Improvements

### Current Issues
- Inconsistent payment redirect implementation
- Some components use query parameters while others use location state
- Potential for payment data loss during navigation
- Duplicated payment data construction logic across multiple components
- Missing required fields in payment requests (e.g., "Reference ID is required")
- Database schema mismatch with payment data structure (column 'payment_details' not found)
- Inconsistent reference ID generation between different payment flows
- Error handling for payment API failures is incomplete
- Fallback to mock implementation in production code
- Multiple payment endpoints with inconsistent behavior
- Lack of proper validation before payment submission
- Incomplete payment record storage in database
- No retry mechanism for failed payments

### Recommended Approach
1. Standardize all payment redirects to use location state
2. Create a dedicated PaymentDetails interface with all required fields
3. Implement a payment context to persist payment data
4. Add fallback mechanisms for direct URL access
5. Improve error handling for payment failures
6. Extract payment data construction into a reusable utility function
7. Centralize payment amount retrieval from the database
8. Implement consistent reference ID generation for all payment types
9. Update database schema to match payment data structure
10. Add comprehensive validation for payment data before submission
11. Create a payment service that handles all payment-related operations
12. Implement proper error recovery for failed payments

### Square Webhook Production Setup

When moving from development to production, the following steps must be completed for payment webhooks:

1. **Domain Requirements**:
   - Secure a proper domain name for the backend API
   - Setup SSL/TLS certificates (required by Square)
   - Configure reverse proxy/load balancer if needed

2. **Square Production Configuration**:
   - Create/upgrade to a production Square account
   - Generate production API keys and credentials
   - Transfer sandbox application configuration to production
   - Update environment variables in deployment environment:
     ```
     SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
     SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=[Production Token]
     SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=[Production Location ID]
     SQUARE_APP_ID=[Production App ID]
     ```

3. **Webhook Security**:
   - Implement Square webhook signature verification:
     ```python
     # Example implementation for webhook.py
     import hmac
     import hashlib
     import base64
     
     @router.post("/square")
     async def handle_square_webhook(request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
         # Get signature from headers
         signature = request.headers.get("x-square-signature")
         if not signature:
             logger.error("Missing Square signature")
             raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Unauthorized")
             
         # Get webhook URL from config
         webhook_url = os.environ.get("SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL")
         
         # Get the webhook signature key from environment
         sig_key = os.environ.get("SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY")
         
         # Get raw payload
         payload_bytes = await request.body()
         payload_str = payload_bytes.decode('utf-8')
         
         # Compute HMAC with SHA1
         hmac_obj = hmac.new(sig_key.encode(), msg=payload_str.encode(), digestmod=hashlib.sha1)
         calculated_signature = base64.b64encode(hmac_obj.digest()).decode()
         
         # Compare signatures
         if not hmac.compare_digest(signature, calculated_signature):
             logger.error("Invalid Square signature")
             raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Unauthorized")
         
         # Continue with normal webhook processing
         # ...
     ```

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for payment events
   - Set up alerts for webhook failures
   - Create dashboard for payment success/failure rates
   - Configure regular audit of payment reconciliation

5. **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Implement idempotent webhook handling (already done)
   - Setup retry mechanism for webhook delivery failures
   - Add fallback webhook handling for critical payment events

6. **Testing Before Launch**:
   - Use Square's production testing tools to verify webhook delivery
   - Process test transactions with real credentials but test card numbers
   - Verify all payment flows end-to-end in staging environment 
   - Conduct load testing to ensure webhook handler performs under pressure

7. **Documentation Update**:
   - Document production webhook URL for team reference
   - Add procedure for webhook troubleshooting
   - Create runbook for common webhook issues
   - Document required credentials and configuration

### Pros and Cons
