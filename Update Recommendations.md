# MGL Website Update Recommendations

## Type System Improvements

### Current Issues
- TypeScript type issues in roster data mapping
- Need for comprehensive refactor of data fetching and state management code

### Recommended Approach
1. Create proper interfaces for all data structures
2. Implement strict type checking for API responses
3. Refactor state management to use proper typing
4. Add type guards where necessary
5. Document type system architecture

## User Experience Improvements

### Loading States
- Add loading indicators for:
  - Data fetching operations
  - Form submissions
  - Payment processing
  - Tournament/League registration
  - Team management operations

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions:
  - Team disbandment
  - Tournament/League registration
  - Payment submission
  - Captain transfer
  - Player removal
  - Tournament/League withdrawal

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
- Add comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Registration logic
  - Payment processing
  - Team management
  - User authentication
  - Form validation
  - State management

### Integration Tests
- Add integration tests for:
  - API endpoints
  - Payment flow
  - Registration flow
  - Database operations

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
- Implement React Error Boundaries for:
  - Payment components
  - Registration forms
  - Team management sections
  - User profile sections

### Retry Logic
- Add retry mechanisms for:
  - Failed API calls
  - Payment processing
  - Data fetching operations
  - Real-time updates

### Error Reporting
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Create error reporting system
- Set up monitoring for critical operations

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Type system improvements
   - Loading states
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Critical error handling

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Unit tests
   - Retry logic
   - Error boundaries
   - Integration tests

3. **Low Priority**
   - Additional UX improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Documentation updates
   - Monitoring system

## Notes
- Each task should be implemented in isolation to prevent regressions
- Changes should be thoroughly tested before deployment
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Document all changes in the project wiki
