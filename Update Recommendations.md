# MGL Website Update Recommendations

## Type System Improvements

### Current Issues
- TypeScript type issues in roster data mapping
- Need for comprehensive refactor of data fetching and state management code

### Recommended Approach
1. Create proper interfaces for all data structures
2. Implement strict type checking for API responses
3. Refactor state management to use proper typing
4. Add type guards where necessary
5. Document type system architecture

## Payment System Improvements

### Current Issues
- Inconsistent payment redirect implementation
- Some components use query parameters while others use location state
- Potential for payment data loss during navigation
- Duplicated payment data construction logic across multiple components
- Missing required fields in payment requests (e.g., "Reference ID is required")
- Database schema mismatch with payment data structure (column 'payment_details' not found)
- Inconsistent reference ID generation between different payment flows
- Error handling for payment API failures is incomplete

### Recommended Approach
1. Standardize all payment redirects to use location state
2. Create a dedicated PaymentDetails interface with all required fields
3. Implement a payment context to persist payment data
4. Add fallback mechanisms for direct URL access
5. Improve error handling for payment failures
6. Extract payment data construction into a reusable utility function
7. Centralize payment amount retrieval from the database
8. Implement consistent reference ID generation for all payment types
9. Update database schema to match payment data structure
10. Add comprehensive validation for payment data before submission
11. Create a payment service that handles all payment-related operations
12. Implement proper error recovery for failed payments

## User Experience Improvements

### Loading States
- Add loading indicators for:
  - Data fetching operations
  - Form submissions
  - Payment processing
  - Tournament/League registration
  - Team management operations

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions:
  - Team disbandment
  - Tournament/League registration
  - Payment submission
  - Captain transfer
  - Player removal
  - Tournament/League withdrawal

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
- Add comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Registration logic
  - Payment processing
  - Team management
  - User authentication
  - Form validation
  - State management

### Integration Tests
- Add integration tests for:
  - API endpoints
  - Payment flow
  - Registration flow
  - Database operations

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
- Implement React Error Boundaries for:
  - Payment components
  - Registration forms
  - Team management sections
  - User profile sections

### Retry Logic
- Add retry mechanisms for:
  - Failed API calls
  - Payment processing
  - Data fetching operations
  - Real-time updates

### Error Reporting
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Create error reporting system
- Set up monitoring for critical operations

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Type system improvements
   - Payment system standardization
   - Loading states
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Critical error handling

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Unit tests
   - Retry logic
   - Error boundaries
   - Integration tests

3. **Low Priority**
   - Additional UX improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Documentation updates
   - Monitoring system

## Notes
- Each task should be implemented in isolation to prevent regressions
- Changes should be thoroughly tested before deployment
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Document all changes in the project wiki
